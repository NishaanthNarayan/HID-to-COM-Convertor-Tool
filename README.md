# HID-to-COM-Convertor-Tool
This is a C# Project, Which Converts the (HID) Human Interface Device to (COM) Component Object Model.


HID - HUMAN INTERFACE DEVICES:

HID stands for Human Interface Device. In the context of USB, HID refers to a standard protocol for communicating with devices that are used to control or interact with a computer, such as keyboards, mice, game controllers, and other input devices. 
The HID protocol allows these devices to communicate with the computer using a standardized language, which makes them easy to use and compatible with a wide range of software and hardware.


COM - COMPONENT OBJECT MODEL:

COM stands for Component Object Model. It is a technology developed by Microsoft that enables software components to communicate with each other across different processes or even computers, within the same network. 
In simple terms, COM is a way for software components (called COM objects) to interact and work together to perform specific tasks. A COM object can be thought of as a black box that provides a set of functionalities and can be used by other components or applications without requiring the user to know how it works internally. 
COM objects are typically created using programming languages like C++ and can be used in a wide range of applications, including desktop applications, web services, and server-based applications.
